# Fastest Language for Speedrunnning Breath of the Wild

This code was written by SamusTea to help speedrunners determine what language is fastest when running Breath of the Wild. If you have any questions about the code or have any suggestions, please message me on Twitter, @SamusTea: https://twitter.com/SamusTea


The language options are:
English, Spanish (Latin America), French (Canada), Japanese, Spanish (Spain), French (France), German, Italian, and Russian.

The cutscenes times are ripped from Swiffy22's YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVaZdsgjWz8

This code runs in Python3. If you would like to run this with Python2, you can replace the `input` function with `raw_input`.
(In vi, you can do this by writing `:%s+input+raw_input+g`)
